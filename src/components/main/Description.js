                        We don't really know where this goes and I'm not sure we really care. 
                        Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. 
                        Let your imagination be your guide. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.
                        It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. It's cold, but it's beautiful. We don't need any guidelines or formats. 
                        All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>
